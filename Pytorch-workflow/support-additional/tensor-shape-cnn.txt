CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

input shape = [B,C,H,W]
B - No. of samples in a batch
C - Color Channels
H,W - Img H, W

Assume that you have [1,1,28,28] image and 3 filters
- Each filter would convolve on the image giving a total of 3 output channels.
- The size of filter, size of output channel would change.
- These output channels are called feature map.
  [
    'Feature' because the output represent particular features from the image, eg. edges.
    These mappings emerge as the network learns from the training
