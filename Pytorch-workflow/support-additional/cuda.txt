GPU is a processor that is good at handling specialized computations
CPU is a processor that is good at handling general computations

Parallel Computing - GPU
[
    A particular computation broken into independent smaller computations, that can be carried out simultaneously.
    The resulting computation is recombined or synchronized to form the result of the original computation.
] 

The number of computations that the main can be broken into depends on 
number of cores on the particular hardware it is run on

CPU - 4/8/16 cores
GPU - Numerous cores

Hence GPU can do parallel computation.

GPU is faster for only particular tasks.
[
    Bottlenecks : Moving from CPU to GPU is costly. So relatively simple tasks may take more time 
although they have simple computation. GPU works well for tasks that can be broken down into many smaller tasks.
If the task is already small, there is not much to gain from trying to break it up and move it to GPU.
