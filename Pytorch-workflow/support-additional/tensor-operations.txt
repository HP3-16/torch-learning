squeeze removes an extra dimension
unsqueeze adds an extra dimension

Elementwise operations need the same shape to be executed
eg: t1 + t2 is only possible if t1.shape == t2.shape

In case of addition (Elementwise operations) to scalar, the scalar is broadcasted to 
the shape of the tensor on which the Elementwise operations are done.
