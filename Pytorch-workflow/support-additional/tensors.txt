Tensors:
Tensors operations need same dtype and devices

Creating Tensors:
1. torch.Tensor(): Class Constructor. by default makes dtype float32

2. torch.tensor(): Factory Function , creates a tensor. dtype is type inferenced
[Factory Function is a function to create an instance of the class instead of using a constructor]

3. torch.as_tensor(): Factory Function, creates a tensor. dtype is type inferenced. The memory is shared.

4. torch.from_numpy(): Factory Function, creates a tensor. dtype is type inferenced. The memory is shared. 

Creating Tensors without data:
1. torch.eye()
