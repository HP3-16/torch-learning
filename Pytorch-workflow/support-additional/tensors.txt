Tensors:
Tensors operations need same dtype and devices

Creating Tensors:
1. torch.Tensor(): Class Constructor. by default makes dtype float32

2. torch.tensor(): Factory Function, creates a tensor

3. torch.as_tensor(): Factory Function, creates a tensor

4. torch.from_numpy(): Factory Function, creates a tensor

Creating Tensors without data:
1. torch.eye()
