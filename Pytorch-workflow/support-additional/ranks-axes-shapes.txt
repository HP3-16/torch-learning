Ranks, Axes and Shapes

Rank: No. of dimensions present in a tensor
      [How many indices are required to access a specific data element in a tensor]

      tensor([[1., 1., 1.],
        [2., 2., 2.],
        [3., 3., 3.],
        [4., 4., 4.]])

        Rank = 2


Axes: The geometric shape in which the tensor is distributed
