# GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS

<p>
This is a practise notebook based Readme file for the learning of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The initial part contains the normal image classification using a standard model in PyTorch and later we implement a GNN model.

A computation graph is a graph at each node containing a blend of features and a neural network/networks.
Eg: Layer0     =>  Layer1      =>  Layer2<br>
    Order           NN outs         NN outs Edge0 
    Invariant       edge 1 
    Aggregation
Every node has it's own computation graph
