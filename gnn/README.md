# GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS

<p>
This is a practise notebook based Readme file for the learning of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The initial part contains the normal image classification using a standard model in PyTorch and later we implement a GNN model

The notebook is a practise I used when Learning a Stanford Course on GNNs using PyTorch Geometric
